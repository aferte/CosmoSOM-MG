SOMMG_training_plot.ipynb is a python notebook to reproduce figures from arxiv:2110.13171.
The training set is available on demand at agnespferte@gmail.com, it includes shear correlation
functions for:
- f(R) gravity in the B0 and Fr0 parametrisation,
- Dilaton model varying xi0,
- Symmetron model varying xi_star and beta_star at a_star = 0.5 and 0.3 (for beta_star = 1.5)
